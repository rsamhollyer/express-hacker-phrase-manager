# User stories to implement

## As a user, I should be able to see how many phrases they've created so I can better manage the list.

On the `/all` route, show a count in an `<h2>` of how many phrases are in the "database"


## As a user, I should be able to see a number next to each phrase so that I know what order I created them in.

Turn the unordered list into one that shows the order. (Hint: use a different HTML tag.)

## As a user, I should be able to be able to see an individual phrase I created previously.

On the `/all` route, make each phrase a clickable `<a href>`. When it is clicked, go to a new route `/show/:id`

Using the `id` as the index, show only that one phrase.

## As a user, I should be able to delete one of the phrases so I don't have to see ones I don't like.

On the `/show/:id` page, add an `<a href>` that displays the text "delete".

When you click it, it should go to the route `/delete/:id`.

Using the `id` as the index, remove that item from the Array of phrases.

On that page, tell the user that the phrase has been deleted.

Show them links to go back to `/all`.
